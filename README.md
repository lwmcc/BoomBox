BoomBox is an app that I have been working on for a long time. But I only work on it when I have spare time. Lately I have had that time to start working on it again. It still has a way to go before completion. I have added a few screen caps, and a video to give an idea of what it will do when complete.

So that app is a way for Spotify users who have a premium account to to view their most recently played songs, and to view their playlists. My idea was to make an app for users to view their tracks with a simple UI.
